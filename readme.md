NYU Bus Tracker
===============

[NYU Bus Tracker](http://www.nyubustracker.com/) is designed to combine the functionality of the NYU
Mobile and Transloc apps (maps with real time bus locations) with the [massive schedules]
(http://www.nyu.edu/life/travel-and-transportation/university-transportation.html) of the NYU bus system.

See the GitHub issues for a list of things that need to be done.
